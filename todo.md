# To-Do

* Turn `customizable` into a top-level metadata? (Instead of a category?)
* Add default parameter/layout/display for "External Links" or "See Also", which explains we're not affiliated but just want to share the best resources we find, and then lists LINK + EXPLANATION?


## Business

* ONCE I HAVE THEWAYWARDMELODY.COM SETUP
  * Change email address to no-reply@thewaywardmelody.com (in SendGrid), verify _that_ domain instead of RodePanda for Snipcart
  * Update Mollie profile with correct domain name. Confirm the webshop is "done" and it should verify.

### Merchandise API

* Actually register webhooks => Add signature/secrets to server for Printify and Printful => TEST THIS SHIT
* @TODO: Do I still need to make my own Snipcart notification when I update orders? (Getting stuff back from Print provider) Or does that happen automatically?
* Any other sanity checks for ALL products in the HUGO/API system?
  * Force myself to manually add a `free` frontmatter parameter when something should be free? And otherwise discard things with price 0?

# Niceties/Future To-Do

* HOME PAGE
  * The home page should look much more _open_ and _custom_ anyway. Custom shop logo, more space, more images, less AI-first-impression.
* Make CURRICULUM page much nicer: graphics, table of contents, an image for the whole "path through the factions"
* Use Metadata Nav Query Parameters for more stuff? + Find a way to allow pagination on _that_ too
  * DISABLED IT COMPLETELY FOR NOW, as it doesn't work with Search, and it's just confusing as long as I haven't built a robust system myself ...
* (Use Snipcart JavaScript SDK to get TAX RATE on-demand? So I can display prices INCLUDING tax for users? Very difficult ...)
* Once we need it, support BRANDS.
  * These get an extra `data` file with the description + images for that brand. (Feels cleaner than polluting the root with _another_ folder ... which we must then hide from the factions ...)
  * Products can just set the `brand` metadata
  * When searching into that taxonomy (term == brand), it simply reads that data file.
* _Maybe_ move banners and faction images into the faction itself, not sure. (Would prevent needing to `lower` the `.Title` and hoping that never breaks ...)
* _Research_ if I can add chapter decorations to `.epub` files too. Maybe with a background image in the ebook_styles.css? (But that would also require including that image every time. OR do we make it a base64 URL/SVG that's embedded? => YES, EPUB SUPPORTS THAT)

## Design

* Snipcart Theming => only colors are easy to change. I'd prefer having access to fonts and stuff too, but that's messy ...
* Try other font combos
* Use the simple grain and doodles as a slight overlay/polishing on these headers, to make them actually manual and consistent in look.
* Some nice doodling/"eye candy" work => something with DREAMCATCHERS and that LINE OF MUSIC NOTES through everything?
  * Just to stow away in some corner once---be SUBTLE---use that "dream catcher" and "melody line" motif!
  * Shop logo (name logo/banner in different dimensions, instead of icon + plain text we have now)

## Business

* Mollie => Get Zakelijke Rekening (ING seems best) to support iDEAL. => Is this really important if I'm selling internationally anyway?
